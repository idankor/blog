title: "2. An Introduction"

My original idea was to collect the best resources (in my opinion) on the subject and organize them logically. While I will provide many links and resources down the road, this is no longer my main goal in this blog. I wish to present you the subject as I understand it. My understanding will change over time, and I will do my best to keep this blog updated, but in the same breath, I find great value in witnessing and documenting the evolution of the learning process.

Now, after the pre-introduction presented in the previous chapters, we finally get to the point: **what is the free-energy principle?** By now, you have surely realized that you will not get a simple answer to this question, but we have to start from somewhere. The free-energy principle (FEP, from now on) is trying to address a profound question: is there a unifying organizing principle for the phenomena of life?

The concept of a unifying theory is no longer alien to the layperson, and its popularity has kept increasing over the last decades. The mother of all unifying theories is the [theory of everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything). You can think about the FEP as a theory of everything whose scope is to explain phenomena of life rather than the whole physical universe. But if the universe is fractal in its nature (a concept we will touch later on), then perhaps the FEP can teach us some things of broader scope that are allegedly beyond that of the phenomena of life: existence itself, the metaphysical nature of reality, etc.

But what the FEP argues precisely? How does it pretend to provide a global principle for the phenomena of life? The main sentence you will encounter upon starting your research about the FEP goes something like this: any living system tries to minimize its free-energy. "What is free-energy?" you might ask. And that is a good question. Probably the million-dollar one.

The short answer is that free-energy is a measure of the amount of surprise (or surprisal) that the system is experiencing, so what the FEP is basically saying is that the core force that drives any living creature is trying to be as less surprised as it possible can (on the long term). Anything that life does revolves around this. Alas, according to the FEP, this is more or less (if not precisely) the definition itself for the phenomena of life: a system that minimizes its surprise as much as it can. Even among those not familiar with the theory, some can immediately find a sense of intuitive logic in that claim, but it is not that straightforward. In this blog, I aim to gradually build an intuitive understanding of the FEP.

Before getting to what surprise actually is and how a living system can minimize it (the short answer is: prediction), we need to lay the scaffolding for this vast and ambitious skyscraper of complexity.

Hold tight; our journey is about to begin, at last.
