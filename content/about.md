<p>
My name is Idan Korenblum, and I work as a psychiatry resident at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center and as a lecturer at the Faculty of Social Welfare & Health Sciences at the University of Haifa.
I graduated from medical school at the University of Pavia (among its alumni are Camillo Golgi, Alessandro Volta, Gerolamo Cardano, and other giants). I wrote my thesis about the social stigma associated with psychiatric disorders, and I am currently considering specializing in the field of addictive disorders.

My main areas of interest revolve around psychedelic substances, consciousness, ontology, and Bayesian approaches to brain function.
