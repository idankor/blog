<p>
My name is Idan Korenblum, and I work as a psychiatry resident at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheba_Medical_Center" target="_tab">Chaim Sheba Medical Center</a> and as a lecturer at the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Haifa" target="_tab">University of Haifa</a>.
I graduated from medical school at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pavia" target="_tab">University of Pavia</a> (among its alumni are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camillo_Golgi" target="_tab">Camillo Golgi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta" target="_tab">Alessandro Volta</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano" target="_tab">Gerolamo Cardano</a>). I wrote my thesis about the social stigma associated with psychiatric disorders, and I am currently considering specializing in the field of addictive disorders.

<p>
My main areas of interest revolve around psychedelic substances, consciousness, ontology, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function" target="_tab">Bayesian approaches to brain function</a>. This blog deals mainly with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle" target="_tab">free-energy principle</a>, one of the most promising and ambitious frameworks in neuroscience today. Sooner or later I will probably discuss all of the topics mentioned above and some other exciting ideas which, in a way, are all tangent to one another.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy skateboarding, playing chess, solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)" target="_tab">CTFs</a> and other puzzles, watching crime documentaries, and listening to Terence McKenna before falling asleep. Two big inspirations for me in neuroscience are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joscha_Bach" target="_tab">Joscha Bach</a> and Karl Friston. You can read a little more about me in the <a href="/chapters/0-start-here/">first chapter</a> of the guide.
