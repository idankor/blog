My name is Idan Korenblum, and I work as a psychiatry resident at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center. I am also a lecturer at the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at the University of Haifa. I graduated from medical school at the University of Pavia. I am currently considering specializing in the field of addictive disorders and developing the field of computational psychiatry.

Other big areas of interest of mine revolve around psychedelic substances, the nature of consciousness, ontology, and Bayesian approaches to brain function.

This blog deals mainly with the free-energy principle (one of the most promising and ambitious frameworks in neuroscience today), but my guess is my writing is going to involve a broader blend of deep questions and interesting ideas. I believe it is fair to say that all of the topics dealt with on this blog are, in a way, all tangent to one another.

When I am not thinking about the meaning of life, I enjoy skateboarding, playing chess, solving CTFs and other puzzles, watching crime documentaries, and listening to Terence McKenna before falling asleep.

Two big inspirations for me in neuroscience are Joscha Bach and Karl Friston. You can read a little more about me in the first chapter of the guide.

Feel free to contact me.
