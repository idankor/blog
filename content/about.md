<p>
My name is Idan Korenblum, and I work as a psychiatry resident at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center and as a lecturer at the Faculty of Social Welfare & Health Sciences at the University of Haifa.
I graduated from medical school at the University of Pavia (among its alumni are Camillo Golgi, Alessandro Volta, Gerolamo Cardano, and other giants). I wrote my thesis about the social stigma associated with psychiatric disorders, and I am currently considering specializing in the field of addictive disorders.

My main areas of interest revolve around psychedelic substances, consciousness, ontology, and Bayesian approaches to brain function. This blog deals mainly with the free-energy principle, one of the most promising and ambitious frameworks in neuroscience today. Sooner or later I will probably discuss most of the topics mentioned above and some other exciting ideas which, in a way, are all tangent to one another.
