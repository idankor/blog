My name is Idan Korenblum, and I work as a psychiatry resident at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center. I am also a lecturer at the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at the University of Haifa. As of this writings, I am currently considering specializing in addictive disorders and computational psychiatry.

My other areas of interest include psychedelic substances, the nature of consciousness, ontology, Bayesian approaches to brain function, and these kinds of creatures.

This blog deals mainly with the free-energy principle, which is one of the most promising and ambitious frameworks in neuroscience today. Nevertheless, I intend to involve a broad blend of deep questions and exciting ideas. I believe it is fair to say that all of the topics dealt with on this blog are, in a way, all tangent to one another.

When I am not thinking about the meaning of life, I enjoy skateboarding, playing chess, solving CTFs and other puzzles, watching crime documentaries, and listening to Terence McKenna before falling asleep.

Two big inspirations for me in neuroscience are Joscha Bach and Karl Friston. You can read a little more about me in the first chapter of the guide.
