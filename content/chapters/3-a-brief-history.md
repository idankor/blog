I am not sure about the exact origins of the FEP. Still, a form of the idea probably traces back to [Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham), according to [this article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-be-energy-efficient-brains-predict-their-perceptions-20211115/). Some refer to this Arab mathematician as "the first scientist" and the father of modern optics. A more prominent figure in the field of the FEP, who developed the idea significantly, is [Hermann von Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz). These two scientists are truly impressive intellectuals, and I welcome you to read a little about their biography.

Another key player in laying the infrastructure for the idea is [Richard Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gregory), who published an [influential paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.1980.0090) in 1980, which argued that perceptual illusions are essentially the brain’s erroneous guesses about the causes of sensory impressions.

The common theme in the ideas of all these scientists is that the brain is a "guessing machine," an inference engine if you'd like. It tries to predict its sensory input, and when the predictions fail, it uses the errors to update its model of the world, but we would get to that later on, so do not worry if you feel confused about these statements at this point.

According to the [Free-Energy User's Guide](https://philarchive.org/rec/MANFEA-2),

> The free energy principle is a modern incarnation of ideas that have been raised sporadically over at least the last five decades. It combines traditions from physics, biology, neuroscience and machine learning.

A further significant development in the field was made by one of the greatest minds ever lived, the physicist [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman). At this point, we will not get into the explanations of his contributions because it will be too hard to understand.

In the 1980s and 1990s, scientists began exploring this idea as a model for visual perception. In 2003, Friston started making bold claims about his scientific model. Eventually, his work led him to develop what we know today as the FEP: a theory of visual perception turned into a theory of how the mind works and then into a theory that explains all of life. It is not the first time we see the elegance of scientific thought when an idea about a specific phenomenon is transformed into a more extensive framework encompassing a much broader territory of phenomenology.

> By 2006, Friston claimed that minimizing free energy is almost everything the brain does. By 2012, Friston asserted that minimizing free energy is almost everything every biological system does.

Now that we have a (very) general idea about the FEP, how it was developed, and the general approach of this blog to the subject, we are ready to tackle the basic constructs that will soon become the main pillars of the FEP.
