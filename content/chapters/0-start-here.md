It is no secret that many of us are waiting for the right moment. I asked myself if I should put the word "right" between quotes while writing the previous sentence, as the more common view on this matter (at least so I believe) is that there is no right moment. But then I did one of my favorite things: I doubted a belief (that I was holding somewhat mindlessly). I cannot be so sure that there is such thing as the "right moment." This is a profound and complex philosophical issue, and perhaps I will discuss it in one of my future writings.

Another motivation for not using quotes in the first sentence is that people's feelings matter more than metaphysical correctness. Many people wait for a specific constellation of conditions (the so-called 'right moment'), especially when the action or decision they intend to make is of great importance to them. As for my case, it seems to me that I drifted unintentionally from the territory of "waiting for a right moment" to the dark kingdom of procrastination.

The project you are reading right now is something I wanted to start some time ago but did not. I waited for the right moment. For me, in this case, the right moment would have been characterized by the following:

1. a calmer period of my life in which I would have more free time and less stress to deal with and
2. feeling more confident with the field I want to write about.

But then I realized that:

1. a calmer period may never arrive and
2. writing about something is one of the most powerful tools to facilitate the learning process.

Before diving into the subject of matter, it is necessary to provide some personal background. In the following chapters, I will expand on the importance of this approach, as it lies at the core of the philosophy behind this project (I am well aware that I still haven't adequately explained what this project exactly is. This too will be discussed soon).

Since I can remember, I have been obsessed with unsolved problems and the concept of mystery in general. As a child, this obsession revolved mainly around concrete matters such as missing people, unresolved crimes, etc. As I grew up, my interest shifted towards the less concrete: the existence of a super-human intelligence, the mechanics of consciousness, the nature of reality, to name a few examples. I am still easily fascinated by true crime documentaries and situations dealing with abnormal mental conditions, but the big metaphysical questions occupy my mind to a much broader extent. There are several such questions, but the main one is probably the following: what the hell is going on?

Although not all of us are intrigued by such topics, I am indeed not the only one. The human species as a whole has become quite obsessed with explaining its own existence, perhaps since the beginning of recorded history (if not before). In fact, our hunger for explanations and understanding can be viewed as the fertile ground for our most extensive endeavors, the propagating force towards technological development, one of the main drives (if not the biggest one) that shape the way we live, act, and feel today.

Nonetheless, it is no secret that some of us are more occupied than others in those topics. Some of us spend very little time (if any at all) wondering about the big questions, and that is okay. But if you are reading these lines, you are probably, like me, spending quite a great deal of mental energy thinking about the mysteries of the human experience.

> The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed. The insight into the mystery of life, coupled though it be with fear, has also given rise to religion. To know what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms-this knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness.

This quote by Albert Einstein, I believe, is one of the most elegant and concise phrasings of this primal hunger for knowledge, the human attraction to the mysterious.

During my medical studies, it became clear to me that I was going to specialize in psychiatryâ€”either that or a career change to mathematics, computer science, or physics. Eventually, I started my psychiatry residency about two and a half years ago (as of this writing). You can read more about me here (link to be provided).

As a young resident, I was part of our hospital journal club, and I had to choose an article to present and discuss it with my peers. I was not too restricted with my choice, but my mentor asked me to find an article that has something to do with psychedelic substances. I came across [this one](https://www.example.com). What can I say? I fell in love.

The article explores three theories, all somewhat connected, about brain function and tries to explain the mechanism of hallucinogenic substances through their lenses. The first read was not easy for me, but I could sense that there was something there. The more I re-read it and researched those theories, the more my curiosity grew. One of them, [the free energy principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle), is the topic of this blog.

Even though my understanding of the article at the time was fundamental, I gave a couple of lectures about it to the public crowd. When I finally presented it to the journal club, I was informed by one of the attendees that [Professor Karl Friston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston), the person that is considered today the main character behind the free energy principle, will be visiting my country for a workshop about the subject. It was a very short notice, but somehow the stars aligned in the sky the right way, and I managed to find the time and attend the workshop. And there I was, sitting in the chair next to Karl Friston, the leading neuroscientist of our time, which I absurdly never heard about until not long ago. When I gave talks about the free energy principle in a couple of night bars in Tel-Aviv, I never imagined that I would sit next to the person I told my audience is perhaps the most brilliant mind of our time. And all that happened so quickly, in a matter of weeks. That was quite a surreal experience.

Since then, I have made significant progress learning about the theory, which was revealed to be one of the most intellectually demanding challenges I have ever encountered in my life. So intellectually demanding that I felt compelled to start documenting my journey towards its understanding. The next chapter will focus on what makes the free energy principle so challenging and how this blog can help.
