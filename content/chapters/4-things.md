If I understand Friston correctly in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIu_dJGyIQI), there are two main approaches to explaining the FEP: the high road and the low road. I recommend that you watch the video now. Don't worry if you get confused or intimidated because the point is getting your mind asking questions. Later on, you will watch it again, and you will be amazed how much sense this video will make to you.

We can assume that there is a consciousness, a subjective experience of existence and life, and we can (try to) reverse engineer it from there to get to the mechanistic understanding of how the brain works. But before we get to things like life or consciousness, I want to "reverse engineer" even more fundamental constructs. We are not sure what reality exactly is. In fact, we cannot be 100% sure about anything. You cannot prove that you are not dreaming right now or that your memories haven't been planted in your brain by a superior form of intelligence. Perhaps you came into existence two seconds ago, and everything you remember is a fake memory. A couple of decades ago, these thought experiments had a much stronger sci-fi scent to them in comparison with modern times (we'll talk about digital physics and the simulation hypothesis in later chapters). But even if these scenarios sound absurd to you, they are still an essential part of a field called ontological philosophy. Most people would estimate with a very high probability that the sun will rise tomorrow morning, but no one can be 100% sure about it.

But wait. Perhaps there is something that we can be absolutely sure of. And that something is the following: **There is something**. We cannot be entirely sure about what the future will bring, and we cannot be quite sure that the past really happened, but there sure is something going on right now. There is an experience of the present moment, which is pretty inevitable. This leads to perhaps the most profound question I know:

> Why is there something rather than nothing?

We will deal with this question later. First, we need to define what a "thing" actually is. Did you ever ask yourself that question? It seems like each of us has a somewhat non-verbal intuition for what a "thing" is, but did you ever try to put it into words?

In my view, 'thing' and 'existence' are closely related concepts. What makes a thing a thing is its boundaries, which separate it from other things. The idea of boundaries plays a massive role in the game of the FEP, so pay close attention. Let us try for a moment to see why it is so hard (if not impossible) to imagine a situation of 'nothingness.' What do you imagine when you try to imagine nothing? How is the absence of existence "looks" or "feels" like? Many people will answer this question by describing an infinitely vast space with nothing in it (do you see the problem in this phrase?), or they would say something like, "it is just all black."

Well, space and black are things. It is not always easy to see what the boundaries of a thing are. In fact, we do not have to constrain ourselves to think about boundaries in physical terms. As you will see further ahead, in the FEP, we conceptualize borders statistically (don't worry if this sounds strange to you right now). The experience of blackness is derived from the behavior of photons and from the processes of energetic transformations. Photons have borders (allegedly). And this is an excellent example of thinking about boundaries in statistical terms. When dealing with subatomic particles, the theory of quantum mechanics assumes that subatomic particles have boundaries, but it also says that we cannot obtain certain information about their boundaries. In other words, the boundaries of subatomic particles are blurry. We cannot know where the particle starts and where it ends with perfect certainty. In fact, according to something called 'quantum superposition,' a particle can be in more than one place simultaneously (until measured). We might know that there is a greater chance for a particle to be in position A over position B, but we cannot know for sure where it is. This is not easy to grasp since our everyday experience shows us, pretty clearly, where macroscopic objects start and where they end.

So for something to exist (or for us to be able to talk about it), it has to have boundaries. It has to be separated from its environment. It is pretty easy to comprehend that an apple is a thing because its separation from its environment is usually obvious. Alas, the air surrounding the apple is constituted from different molecules than the apple's molecules. Let us treat a less obvious case: the case of a water vortex. Is water vortex a thing? Well, if we can think about it and talk about it, our intuition tells us it is indeed a thing. But a water vortex is made of water molecules, and its environment is made of water molecules as well. So what are its boundaries?

The vortex is bounded not by the typology of its atoms but by their kinematic dynamics, the way they move. Their movement is characterized by a unique pattern markedly different from the pattern of the surrounding water particles. The situation is somewhat similar with humans: every seven years (more or less), a complete turnover of all the atoms we are made of occurs. We are not the atoms that constitute us. They keep changing. However, other parameters remain relatively constant (our general geometric form, our temperature and blood pressure, our pH, to name a few).

So things "come" into existence when there are boundaries. What that means, if you think about it carefully, is that the existence of one thing necessitates the existence of a second thing. For there to be a thing, it has to have boundaries, which implies that there is an external environment: a second thing. This conclusion raises some interesting insights about the nature of reality. First, there is the idea that all there is are relations between things: nothing can exist by itself. And second, we can identify a motif here: the number two. If the line of reasoning brought so far is correct, then existence is tightly related to this number.

On the other hand, we can view all the boundaries we recognize as arbitrary. This is the main idea of many eastern religions. It also seems one of the most essential characteristics of the psychedelic experience: the dissolution of the self, the feeling of "oneness" with the universe.

But if we go back to the number two for a moment, it is elementary to see how it is a motif in the universe: duality is everywhere. Information is essentially ones and zeros (we will get to that); there are night and day, male and female, hot and cold, magnetic poles, etc.

To conclude:

> If you want to talk about something, there has to be a separation between the thing you are talking about and everything else.

> If there were no boundaries, there would be nothing because there wouldn't be a distinction between the thing and not-that-thing.

These quotes are taken from Karl Friston's YouTube video I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Now we know what a thing is, kind of. In the next chapter, we will discuss what happens when several things interact together and form what is known as a _system_.
