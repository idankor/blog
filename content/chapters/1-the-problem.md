Before getting to what the free-energy principle is precisely about, allow me to explain why it is so difficult to learn.

> At Columbia’s psychiatry department, I recently led a journal club for 15 PET and fMRI researhers, PhDs and MDs all, with well over $10 million in NIH grants between us, and we tried to understand Friston’s 2010 Nature Reviews Neuroscience paper – for an hour and a half. There was a lot of mathematical knowledge in the room: three statisticians, two physicists, a physical chemist, a nuclear physicist, and a large group of neuroimagers – but apparently we didn’t have what it took. I met with a Princeton physicist, a Stanford neurophysiologist, a Cold Springs Harbor neurobiologist to discuss the paper. Again blanks, one and all.

This quote is taken from the journal [Neuropsychoanalysis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15294145.2010.10773634).

There is something paradoxical about the free energy principle. On the one hand, it is currently [one of the most promising frameworks with
which to address a unified explanation of life-related phenomena](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/2/238/pdf). Some predict its future impact to be comparable with the theory of evolution and would bet on Friston winning a Nobel prize sooner or later. A simple google search would quickly demonstrate the important status the theory has gained over the last decade. On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to understand, as seen in the first quotation. So difficult that there is a humorous claim according to which no one other than Friston truly understands it (there is also a [parodic Twitter account](https://twitter.com/farlkriston), which is very amusing). How so?

According to [this useful guide](https://philpapers.org/rec/MANFEA-2), there are three reasons for that:

> 1. The mathematics are unfamiliar to many philosophers, and even to biologists and cognitive scientists.

> 2. The framework was developed rapidly by a small but dedicated group of researchers, limiting its accessibility while expanding its scope.

> 3. The framework makes claims across both mathematical and empirical domains, and the dialectical relationships between these are unclear.

Of course, this blog welcomes everybody, but mainly aims for an audience without a background in advanced mathematics. In other words: I aspire to make the free-energy principle accessible to the layperson. I am not the first to make such an attempt, but even the resources considered to be introductory about the subject are pretty hard to read and digest.

The approach I intend to use in this blog is to take the reader by the hand. If you have already started to read about the theory (and do not have a degree in physics or mathematics), you probably found the experience pretty intimidating. To further elaborate on the first reason mentioned above: it's not only the math. We are talking about a very multidisciplinary territory. As you can read on Jared Tumiel's [Syllabus for the Curious](https://jaredtumiel.github.io/blog/2020/10/14/spinning-up-in-ai.html), the free energy principle requires knowledge in many fields: computational neuroscience, control theory, cybernetics, statistical mechanics, information theory, Hamiltonian mechanics, Bayesian inference, and machine learning, to mention a few. When I first engaged in the subject, I did not even know calculus. All I had was some medium-level programming skills (at best), common sense, and a powerful motivation driven by my intellectual hunger. As of this writing, I still lack the prerequisites to acquire a deep understanding of the free-energy principle, but I decided that this is not a journey I want to take all by myself.

I do not know how many people will find this blog useful since it seems to me that most of those who find interest in the subject are usually equipped with the tools needed to deepen in it. A big part of those who are not, on the other side, cannot seem to penetrate even the most outer shell of the discipline, so they give up before they can know if it is of interest to them. Until now, I used to have an opposite tendency regarding learning new fields (say, a new program language, for example). Most of the resources for beginners are too basic for me, and I get bored quickly. I would not get too deep into the philosophy and psychology of learning here, but you get the point. Nevertheless, I am sure at least a few share my status; those positioned in the area characterized by a good basic understanding of science but lack the more advanced knowledge required.

So this is the moment to clarify: **I am not an expert on the topic**, to put it gently. There might be errors in my writings, and some of these errors may be fundamental and can potentially misguide you. That being said, I see a tremendous value in having this emotional support provided by going through the learning process together. For those of you who will choose to take this journey with me, I do promise an interesting and exciting ride.

In addition to this blog, I run an online journal club that deals with papers on the free-energy principle. I welcome you to [contact me](mailto:idankor@gmail.com) regarding anything that has to do with the subject, be it a question, feedback, idea, or anything else.
